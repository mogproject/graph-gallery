# Venn Diagrams

A Venn diagram, popularized by John Venn in the 1880s, represents the logical relation between a finite number of sets. Here we show one way of drawing Venn diagrams, extending to higher numbers of sets up to $$n = 7$$.
We design our diagrams not to make any region too small, which tends to happen in [Edwardsâ€“Venn diagrams][wiki]{:target="_blank"}.

How do Venn diagrams relate to graphs? Here are some considerations.

- What does the [planar dual][dual]{:target="_blank"} of a Venn diagram tell?
- If each set represents a vertex, where can you find edges? How about [cliques][clique]{:target="_blank"}?
