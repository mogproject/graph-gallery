# Small Graphs

Here we have visualizations of all non-isomorphic simple graphs with $$n \leq 5$$ vertices, with a special focus on edge editing. Cluster graphsーa disjoint union of complete graphsーare highlighted so that we can easily trace cluster editing. It also includes a table of basic graph invariants such as radius and the chromatic number.
